Hello welcome to GausHaus

If you are looking to use GausHaus please review the information on our wiki https://2020.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Gaushaus 

Once you are caught up with that and are ready to start measuring please use the GAUSHAUS_USEME.r script

If you are interested in the future of GausHaus and want to see a very messy closet file GAUSHAUSWIP.r is also available

Hope you enjoy this software as much as I did making it. <3
